    "\n",
    "> [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) is an open-source development kit for building **AI agents** and **multi-agent workflows** for .NET and Python. It brings together and extends ideas from [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) and [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) projects, combining their strengths while adding new capabilities.\n",

    "| Category | Description |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **AI Agents** | Individual agents that use LLMs to process user inputs, call tools and MCP servers to perform actions, and generate responses |\n",
    "| **Workflows** | Graph-based workflows that connect multiple agents and functions to perform complex, multi-step tasks |\n",

    "### When to Use AI Agents\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Autonomous decision-making** and ad hoc planning\n",
    "- **Trial-and-error exploration** and conversation-based interactions\n",
    "- **Customer Support** - handling multi-modal queries using tools to look up information\n",
    "- **Code Generation** - assisting with implementation, reviews, and debugging\n",
    "- **Research Assistance** - searching, summarizing, and synthesizing information\n",

    "| **ChatAgent** | AI persona with instructions, tools, and chat client | `agent_framework.ChatAgent` |\n",
    "| **Thread** | Conversation state container with message history | `agent.get_new_thread()` |\n",
    "| **Run** | Single execution via `agent.run()` - handles everything | Returns `AgentRunResponse` |\n",
    "| **Tool** | Python function with type hints - auto-schema generation | Just a `def` with `Annotated` types |\n",
